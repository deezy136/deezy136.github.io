 It wasn’t till after college that I found out that I love computer programming. I graduated college with a B.S. in cellular and molecular biology. What lead me to computer programming was a friend who was a software engineer. He introduce me to many different languages and projects, he was working on at the time. I was extremely intrigued at how code works, the diversity of things you can do, and how grasping and understanding turns you into a virtual carpenter. I felt that I choose the wrong degree. Because in the back of my mind I knew jobs would ask me “How is biology going to help you with programming?”. I didn let that stop me for pursing something I loved. So, I started learning java first by utilizing tutorials, free online classes and taking advantage of the free eBooks that are available online. From there I just studied and played with multiple languages. I built a game app called save the humans in C# for the windows app store. I learned how to make a toy shop website using ASP.NET with a SQL database. I have made a Whack-a-Mole game for android using a free eBook I got online. I’m currently working on a chess engine using HTML, JavaScript, CSS. So ever since I began my path to be a software engineer, I have never stopped learning and trying to make my dream of becoming a SE into an everyday reality. 

Thank you for reading my blog.
